# IMPORTANT ----

function extensively and well tested, DB initialized and working

connection via localhost:3000, return and log errors extensively

unit tests were completed extensively, 100% coverage.

dao, service, transport layers were tested extensively

assessment for cognizant
using net http for routing, simple and easy to use, best suited for this assessment

-- later on added gorillamux for easier routing to specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.),
e.g POST book, GET book, able to use the same routes with different specifications

created and tested first API, 
server runs on localhost:3000

using datadog mocksql to mock several behaviours throughout the layers
for easier testing

TO WORK ON:
db connection pooling in order to handle larger userbase(which my project wont have XD)

authentication for connection 

other crud requests
